## Banking-System-Application
## Bank Management System Project
## Description
This project is a Command Line Interface (CLI) application for managing bank accounts, developed in Python using SQLAlchemy ORM. The system allows users to create bank accounts, deposit money, withdraw money, and check their account balance,view their trasactions history and can delete their account. Data storage is managed through a SQLite database, and the project follows object-oriented programming principles.

## Features

**Withdrawal** Users can withdraw money from their accounts, with validation to ensure sufficient balance.
**Check Balance** Users can view their account balances.
**Delete**Users can delete their account.
**view customers**users can view cutsomer.
**view transactionshistory**users can view their transactionshistory.
## Project Structure

**models** Defines the SQLAlchemy ORM models for the database tables and their relationships.
**db/** Directory containing the SQLite database and Alembic migration files.
**Pipfile** Contains the projectâ€™s dependencies, including SQLAlchemy and Alembic.

## Documentation
The project is structured to separate scripted elements from object-oriented code. All functions and classes are properly documented in the codebase.
The CLI includes input validation and clear prompts to guide users through the banking operations.
